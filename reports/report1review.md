##### Report by David Papp

[This report](https://github.com/davpapp/ThinkStats2/blob/master/Reports/report1.md) looks at standardized test score data from the [College Scorecard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data), provided by the US Department of Education, with the goal of comparing different scores across regions. In particular, the author seems interested in looking at ACT and SAT scores, and how the midwestern United States compares to the rest of the country.

The report presents the PMFs for ACT scores split by region, then follows up with the PDFs of the ACT/SAT score ratios. One problem I had with this section was the layout of the report; the text mentions some plots that the author made but did not include in the report, and then gives us two (unlabeled) figures that likely should have had separate descriptions rather than a joint one at the end. The format of "Description 0, Figure 1, Figure 2, Description 1, Description 2" didn't really sit well with me; that, combined with the lack of axes labels on the second figure, made me think that the two graphs were more closely related than they actually were. Additionally, much of the writeup talks about "this graph" without making it clear which one it refers to (likely due to the lack of figure captions), so it wasn't obvious at first glance where the results were coming from.

The actual analysis, however, is well done. It results in a ratio difference and a Cohen effect size, which convey enough information to be useful and are appropriate for the target audience. These results definitely help answer the report's motivating question of how ACT and SAT scores differ by region; however, it was not initially clear that the goal was to compare ACT/SAT ratios. From the phrasing in the introduction, I expected the results to instead focus on the differences in, say, percentile rank for both tests rather than the ratios of one over the other. Nonetheless, this report is very good, and would be excellent with some updated wording and formatting.
