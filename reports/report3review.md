##### Review by Joey Maalouf
##### Report by Radmer van der Heyde

[This report](https://github.com/rvanderheyde/ThinkStats2/blob/master/reports/report3.md) aims to explore the driving cause behind a news story's word count, which the author believes is representative of the media's interest in the topic. He uses data collected by the Pew Research Center, in their [2012 News Coverage Index dataset](http://www.journalism.org/datasets/2012-news-coverage-index-data-set/).

There are placeholders in the report for eight figures, but the images themselves are nowhere to be found; this somewhat detracts from the report, but the descriptive paragraphs immediately after each one do a decent enough job of explaining what the figure would show.
