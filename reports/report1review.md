[This report](https://github.com/davpapp/ThinkStats2/blob/master/Reports/report1.md) looks at standardized test score data from the [College Scorecard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data), provided by the US Department of Education, with the goal of comparing different scores across regions. In particular, the author seems interested in looking at ACT and SAT scores, and how the midwestern United States compares to the rest of the country.

The report presents the PDFs for both ACT and SAT scores overall, then splits the data by region and calculates the PMFs of the ACT/SAT score ratios. One problem I had with this section was the layout of the report; first comes Figure 1's description, then Figure 1, then Figure 2, then Figure 2's description. The inconsistency was a little confusing, especially since Figure 2 had no axes labels in the report (despite having them in the notebook) and neither figure was captioned. All together, it made me think that the two graphs were more closely related than they actually were. Additionally, much of the writeup talks about "this graph" without making it clear which one it refers to, so it wasn't obvious at first glance where the results were coming from.

The actual analysis, however, is well done. It results in a ratio difference and a Cohen effect size, which convey enough information to be useful and are appropriate for the target audience. These results definitely help answer the report's motivating question of how ACT and SAT scores differ by region; however, it was not initially clear that the goal was to compare ACT/SAT ratios. From the phrasing in the introduction, I expected the results to instead focus on the differences in, say, percentile rank for both tests rather than the ratios of one over the other. Nonetheless, this report is very good, and would be excellent with some updated wording and formatting.
